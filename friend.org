#+TITLE: Configuration Specific To Tariq's HP Pavilion Desktop.
#+STARTUP: indent hidestars
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil ^:nil

So this is basically the configuration file for friend, the HP Pavilion Desktop running Crunchbang Waldorf. Dual-screen monitor setup.

* Before we begin
Anyway, as with all hostname-specific machines, this little fella runs the following code to load the common features I expect from all my emacs instances:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "tariqk-common.org" starter-kit-dir))
#+end_src

* What goes in here
Settings for emacs specific to HP Pavilion Desktop, running CrunchBang Waldorf, with the OpenBox Window Manager. This configuration assumes a display area of 1600 Ã— 900, 500 GB HDD, 250 GB SDD, 4 GB RAM, and a (presumably, I can't tell) x64 Intel Core Duo i3 Processor.

* The Settings themselves
Actual settings go here.

The goals of these settings is to:
- Maximize screen real estate.
- Minimize eye strain.

** Custom faces

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces
'(default ((t (:foundry "unknown" :family "Liberation Mono" :height 100)))))
#+end_src

** Window Setup The Way I Like It (Here)
Basically, let's keep it transparent, and let's put in a color scheme.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'color-theme)
(color-theme-solarized-dark)
(transparent 55 55)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

* TODO Other things to do.
- [ ] Test this out and see if it's working.
  + [ ] Remove annoyances (menu-bar, light color-scheme).
  + [ ] Install the color theme file and set it up here.
- [X] Put together an org-mode framework.
- Setup:
  + [ ] Git?
  + [ ] Common Lisp?
