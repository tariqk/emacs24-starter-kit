#+TITLE: Configuration Specific To Tariq's Asus Eee 1001HA Netbook.
#+STARTUP: indent hidestars
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil ^:nil

So this is basically the configuration file for munchkin, the little Asus Eee 1001HA that currently runs on Linux Wheezy. It's a tiny ickle system, and the only thing smaller than this is the Raspberry Pi that I've got, but that's not running emacs. Yet.

* Before we begin
Anyway, as with all hostname-specific machines, this little fella runs the following code to load the common features I expect from all my emacs instances:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "tariqk-common.org" starter-kit-dir))
#+end_src

* What goes in here
Settings for emacs specific to an Asus Eee 1001HA Netbook, running Debian Wheeze, with the awesome window manager. This configuration assumes a display area of 1024 Ã— 600, 160 GB HDD, 2 GB RAM, and a tiny Intel Atom Processor running at 1.6 GHz.

* The Settings themselves
Actual settings go here.

The goals of these settings is to:
- Maximize screen real estate.
- Minimize eye strain.

** Custom faces
As it is right now, the fonts are a little too big, although the font (DejaVu Sans Mono) is pretty okay. Let's keep the font, but shrink the font (originally 113, now 100).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces
'(default ((t (:foundry "unknown" :family "DejaVu Sans Mono" :height 100)))))
#+end_src

** Window Setup The Way I Like It (Here)
Basically, let's keep it transparent, and let's put in a color scheme.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(transparent 95 95)
(require 'color-theme)
(load-theme 'sanityinc-solarized-dark t)
(eval-after-load "color-theme"
  '(progn
     (color-theme-initialize)
     (color-theme-sanityinc-solarized-dark)))
#+end_src

** Setting up SLIME

Since I'll only be running Common Lisp on munchkin, I'll put the settings here for the time being. This presupposes that SBCL is installed, it's installed in =/usr/bin/sbcl=, and so on and so forth.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; src = http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/Installation.html
  (setq inferior-lisp-program "/usr/bin/sbcl")       ; the Lisp system
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/projects/lisp/slime/")  ; the SLIME directory
  (require 'slime)
  (slime-setup)
#+END_SRC

And then there's more tweaks to speed up loading slime:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; src = http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/Loading-Swank-faster.html
  (setq slime-lisp-implementations
        '((sbcl ("sbcl" "--core" "sbcl.core-for-slime"))))
#+END_SRC


* TODO Other things to do.
- Setup:
  + [ ] Python + virtualenv
  + [ ] Common Lisp?
  + [X] Lua-mode for awesome configuration
